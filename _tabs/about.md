Hi hi.

my name is Lior Ribak, Iâ€™m 25 and currently working for SentinelOne as a Senior Security Researcher, researching and developing malware detection logics.

I always found operating systems fascinating, and especially the Linux kernel and its inner-working mechanisms.

I believe that itâ€™s possible to get into any field and get self-educated in todayâ€™s new knowledge age, so in this blog, Iâ€™ll describe any new intriguing tech problems and solutions I come across.

Recently I got interested in Machine Learning.  
I strive to learn enough to the level where I can build models for real-life usage, even though Iâ€™m not a mathematician and I didnâ€™t study any in a university.  
so letâ€™s see how it turns out.

Oh and in general I like solving problems, and even more, I like finding them ðŸ™‚
